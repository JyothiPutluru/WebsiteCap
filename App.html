        <p>Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though
            it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its
            ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it
            looks pretty real.”

            As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”

            The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”,
            looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

            Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source
            behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
            consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage
            from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the
            Roman philosopher Cicero.
        </p>

        <p>In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of
            Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted

        <p>Salamanders are a group of amphibians with a lizard-like appearance, including short legs and a tail in both

        <p>Several species of salamander inhabit the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest, including the
            Ensatina, the Northwestern Salamander and the Rough-skinned Newt. Most salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt
            for insects, worms and other small creatures.</p>
